# setDefaultNetworkInterfaceMac
A really simple python app for mac OSX to select default network interface by command line

This tool is useful when more than one connection is active at the same time and you need to select the default one.
The same behavior can be reproduced moving UP/DOWN the connections in "System Preferences" -> "Network"

sudo privileges needed
